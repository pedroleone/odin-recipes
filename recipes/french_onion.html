            <li>⅔ cup shredded vegan cheese</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat buttery spread and oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, and salt. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often. Reduce heat to very low and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are very tender and brown, 50 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 to 4 minutes. Blend in broth, sherry, and Dijon mustard. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Stir in sherry vinegar.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Ladle soup into 6 oven-proof bowls. Top each bowl with a slice of toast and some vegan cheese. Broil until cheesy is bubbly and golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
