        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This vegan cornbread is made with whole-wheat flour and sweetened with agave syrup. It got votes as being better than traditional cornbread muffins by my anti-vegan roommates! They can also be made macrobiotic if you substitute the agave with maple syrup.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>½ cup whole-wheat pastry flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup applesauce</li>
            <li>½ cup soy milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup agave nectar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>


        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a muffin pan.</li>
            <li>Combine the cornmeal, flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl; stir in the applesauce, soy milk, and agave nectar. Slowly add the oil while stirring. Pour the mixture into the muffin pan.</li>

        </ol>
